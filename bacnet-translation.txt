"BACnetDS" is written with the bacpypes library, thanks to which it was possible to create
BACnet IP enabled device server in the Python programming language. This device
classes have the following properties:
1. IP - IP address of the computer on which we run the "BACnetDS" class device,
2. ObjectName - the name of the device,
3. ObjectIdentifier - device identifier,
4. MaxApduLengthAccepted - maximum PDU length,
5. SegmentationSupported - segmentation setup, available options are:
a) segmentedBoth
b) segmentedTransmit
c) segmentedReceive
d) noSegmentation
6. Properties - attribute configuration. Based on this property, they stay dynamically
generated attributes.
Example:
```
ip_address = 192.168.155.178; BACnet_type = device; instance = 555;write = True; property_name = location;```
data_type = CharacterString
All fields except write are obligatory, the appropriate values ​​must be separated
lined with colons. Precise description:
a) ip_address - the IP address of the device with which we communicate,
b) BACnet_type - type of device with which we communicate, e.g. device,
c) instance - the instance number of the device with which we communicate,
d) write - if this property is set to "True" then the attribute will be able to
write,

e) property_name - name of the variable that the attribute will represent, e.g. pre-
sentValue,
f) data_type - type of variable that the attribute will represent.
